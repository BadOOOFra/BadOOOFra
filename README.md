# About Me:
Hi I'm Franz, I'm studying economics at the University of Basel in my second semester, a mix of business administration and economics. Besides university, I am very interested in computer science and am currently working on my final project for the CS50x class I did in my spare time. My final project will be a website where you can write your daily diary and track your feelings and sleep depending on the day, the special thing? The website has a face recognition feature which opens a personal page for each user based on their webcam, and there will also be an AI-based chatbot that I am working on. After that I would like to specialize in particular with CS50p in Python and then complete the CS50ai course.
